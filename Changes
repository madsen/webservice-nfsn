Revision history for WebService-NFSN

1.03   2014-04-30
	- Don't use NFSN's internal CA certificate
	  The API server now uses a Thawte certificate instead.

1.02   2011-12-21
	- Require correct version of Exporter

	- Fix possible installation problem:

	    Module::Build needs to be at least 0.36

1.01   2011-11-20
	- Fix possible installation problem:

	    parent needs to be in configure_requires

1.00   2011-11-11
	- Require libwww-perl 6.00

	- Use parent instead of base

0.10   2011-05-05
	- If you have LWP 6.00 or better, WebService::NFSN will now
	  automatically verify the server's certificate to protect you
	  against man-in-the-middle attacks.

	- Concatenate generated code to use fewer string evals

0.09   2010-11-11
	- Use Scalar::Util's reftype instead of UNIVERSAL::isa

	- Cleaned up usage of eval and $@ (using Try::Tiny where possible)

	- Changed examples/nfsn.pl to get credentials from .nfsn-api

	- Switched from Digest::SHA1 to Digest::SHA, because the
	  latter became a core module in Perl 5.10.

0.08   2008-09-28
	- The constructor now reads login credentials from .nfsn-api
	  if you don't supply them as parameters.

0.07   2008-09-27
	- Added the optional ttl parameter to the DNS addRR method.

0.06   2008-08-28
	- Added the addSite method to Account objects

	- If the authentication timestamp is out of range, appends both
	  the client's & server's time to the debug field of the error.

0.05   2008-04-25
	- Now compatible with JSON::XS 2 (but still works with 1.x).
	  You can also substitute pure-Perl JSON 2, but it's slower.

0.04   2007-12-19
	- Added the listForwards method to Email objects

0.03   2007-08-09
	- Added the sites property to Member objects

0.02   2007-07-07
	- Now does parameter validation on method calls

	    Omitting a required parameter now generates a client-side
	    error.  Using an unknown parameter generates a warning.

	- Initial release
